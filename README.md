# Maze
Maze Java project. Using stack, queue and more.

When you run some file that contains a maze, you'll see the coordinates and the resolution of this, or some exception message if this maze 
isn't right.

There are 2 folders inside this project. W represents wrong mazes and R represents right mazes. If you want to test, you need to run the
main method and tyoe "R/'nameOfFile.txt'" to see the represation of a right example of maze or "W/'nameOfFile.txt'" to see a representation 
of the wrong example.
