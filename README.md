# Maze
Maze Java project. Using stack, queue and more.

When you run some file that contains a maze, you'll see the coordinates and the resolution or some exception message if this maze doesn't work.

There are 2 folders inside this project. W represents wrong mazes and R represents right mazes. If you want to test, you need to run the
main method and type "R/'nameOfFile.txt'" to see the representation of a right example of maze or "W/'nameOfFile.txt'" to see the representation of the wrong example.
